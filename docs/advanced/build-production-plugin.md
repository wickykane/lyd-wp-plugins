# Build production plugin

{% hint style="warning" %}
Never adjust `package.json`'s `version` and `CHANGELOG.md` **manually**!
{% endhint %}

Building a production plugin is **completely covered by the GitLab CI**. That means if you push changes to the `master` branch the pipeline automatically generates the installable `.zip` file and syncs it to wordpress.org (if configured). The plugin itself can be downloaded through [GitLab Releases](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/) or Job artifacts. ` package.json``index.php ` and `CHANGELOG.md` is automatically generated by `yarn lerna publish` and [`yarn build`](../usage/available-commands/plugin.md#build).

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure `GITLAB_TOKEN` is set with a [personal token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html) in your GitLab CI variables. Learn more [here](../gitlab-integration/extend-gitlab-ci-pipeline.md#available-variables).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Nothing more to say, simply follow the Git flow and automate the release management!
{% endhint %}

If you really want to build the plugin locally, you can run [`yarn build`](../usage/available-commands/plugin.md#build) in your plugin folder.
